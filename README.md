# Thesis Template for LaTeX

This repository contains a LaTeX template for writing a Bachelor’s or Master’s thesis. It is designed to meet common formatting requirements while providing a clean and organized structure for your work.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using this template, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

1. **LaTeX Distribution**: 
   - For Windows: [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/)
   - For macOS: [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/)
   - For Linux: Install TeX Live using your package manager.

2. **Editor**: You can use any text editor, but it's recommended to use an integrated development environment (IDE) for LaTeX, such as:
   - [TeXShop](http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/)
   - [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
   - [TeXworks](https://www.tug.org/texworks/)

### Structure of the Template

The main components of the template are:

- **main.tex**: The main file where you can compile your thesis.
- **src/**: A directory that contains various sections of your thesis, such as the introduction, methods, results, and conclusion.
- **images/**: A directory for any images or logos you want to include in your thesis.
- **references.bib**: A bibliography file for managing your references.

### Steps to Use the Template

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   
2. Update Title Page:

- Open main.tex and edit the title, author name, and other details on the title page.

3. Modify Sections:

- Edit the files in the src/ directory to include your content. Each file represents a section of your thesis.
- Ensure you keep the same file names (e.g., 1_introduction.tex, 2_basics.tex, etc.) for proper compilation.

4. Add Images:

- Place your images in the images/ directory and update the paths in main.tex as needed.

5. Citations and References:

- Use the references.bib file to manage your bibliography. You can add citations in your text using the \cite{} command.

6. Compile the Document:

- Use your LaTeX editor to compile main.tex. This will generate a PDF of your thesis.

7. Check the Output:

- Open the generated PDF to ensure everything is formatted correctly.

### Customization
- **Header and Footer**: The template uses the fancyhdr package for customizing headers and footers.
- **Fonts and Spacing**: The template is configured to use Arial font and 1.5 line spacing.
- **Chapter and Section** Formatting: Modify the titleformat commands in the preamble to change how chapters and sections are formatted.

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:

- Ensure all packages are installed. You can do this through your LaTeX distribution’s package manager.
- Check for typos in file names and paths.
- Look at the compilation log for error messages to pinpoint issues.

## Conclusion
This template provides a solid foundation for your thesis. Feel free to modify the styles and formats to suit your needs. Good luck with your thesis writing!
